I was gifted an AeroGarden over the holidays and was admittedly a bit skeptical about the ability to harvest enough to eat from such a small device. I'm proud to say it has proven me wrong after two harvests. 

No, I'm not going to be canning/freezing enough for several meals after gathering from my AeroGarden. But the ease-of-use more than makes up for this with alerts on when to water and when to fertilize. The lights are automatically set for the type of garden I'm growing, so no need for any fiddling there either. After a couple of more cycles, I intend to do a longer post but for now my AeroGarden looks promising as a new source of food and an extension of my garden.
